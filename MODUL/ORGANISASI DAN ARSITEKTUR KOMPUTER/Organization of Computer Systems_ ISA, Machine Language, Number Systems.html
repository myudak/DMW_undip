</p><h3>2.1. ISA and Machine Language </h3>

<p><a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mssz/CompOrg/PatHen-Readings.html#ExSec2.1"><b>Reading Assignments and Exercises</b></a> 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The instruction set architecture (ISA) is a protocol
that defines how a computing machine appears to a machine language
programmer or compiler.  The ISA describes the (1) memory model, (2)
instruction format, types and modes, and (3) operand registers, types,
and data addressing.  Instruction types include <i>arithmetic</i>,
<i>logical</i>, <i>data transfer</i>, and <i>flow control</i>.
Instruction modes include <i>kernel</i> and <i>user</i> instructions.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">ISAs are specified in formal definition documents,
for example, for the V9 SPARC machine and Java Virtual Machine.

</p><h4>2.1.1. Hierarchical View</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As discussed previously, computing languages are
translated from <i>source code</i> to <i>assembly language</i> to
<i>machine language</i>, as illustrated notionally in Figure 2.1.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/Figure2.1-CompLang.gif"><br><br>
<b>Figure 2.1.</b> Example of computing language translation,
adapted from [Maf01]</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The implementation of the ISA in hardware is couched
in terms of the <i>fetch-decode-execute cycle</i> illustrated in
Figure 2.2.  In the <i>fetch</i> step, operands are retrieved from
memory.  The <i>decode</i> step puts the operands into a format that
the ALU can manipulate.  The <i>execute</i> cycle performs the
selected operation within the ALU.  Control facilitates orderly
routing of data, including I/O to the ALU's external environment
(e.g., peripheral devices such as disk or keyboard).

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/Figure2.2-FDEcycle.gif"><br><br>
<b>Figure 2.2.</b> Basic ISA cycle, where fetch gets operands from
memory, decode translates the operands into a format the ALU can
accept, and execute performs an ALU operation on the decoded operands - 
adapted from [Maf01]</p>

<h4>2.1.2. Machine Language</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Machne language instructions are of four types:
Arithmetic, Logical, Data transfer, and Branches (also called <i>flow
control</i>), as follows:

</p><ul><p></p><li><i>Arithmetic</i>: <code>add</code> (addition),
<code>sub</code> (subtraction), <code>mult</code> (multiplication),
<code>div</code> (division)

<p></p></li><li><i>Logical</i>: <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>,
<code>srl</code> (shift right logical), <code>ssl</code> (shift left
logical)

<p></p></li><li><i>Data Transfer</i>: <code>lw</code> (load word),
<code>sw</code> (store word), <code>lui</code> (load upper immediate)

<p></p></li><li><i>Branches</i>: 

<ul><p></p><li><i>Conditional:</i> <code>beq</code> (branch on equal),
<code>bne</code> (branch on not-equal), <code>slt</code> (set on less-than),
</li></ul>

<ul><p></p><li><i>Unconditional:</i> <code>j</code> (jump),
<code>jr</code> (jump register), <code>jal</code> (jump-and-link)
</li></ul>

</li></ul>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The MIPS instruction format uses the KISS principle
(keep it simple and stupid).  As we say more formally:

</p><blockquote>
<b>Design Principle #1:</b> <i>Simplicity favors regularity.</i>
</blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This means that the MIPS instruction format is
the same for all instructions.  Each instruction begins with an
<i>opcode</i> that tells the machine what to do, followed by one
to three <i>operand symbols</i>.  

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/Figure2.3-MIPSinstr.gif"><br><br>
<b>Figure 2.3.</b> MIPS instruction - simple addition example,
adapted from [Maf01].  These instructions are <i>symbolic</i>
examples of what MIPS actually understands.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As an example of the symbolic notation used in
Figure 2.3, consider the following equation, expressed in C
language format, accompanied by its translation into MIPS assembly
language:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-ex1.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Symbolic names make assembly language code more
readable.  In the preceding example, note that we have <i>temporary
variables</i> t0 and t1, as well as <i>input/result</i> variables f,
g, h, i, and j.  In MIPS, we also have eight <i>temporary
registers</i> labelled <code>$t0</code> through <code>$t7</code> and
nine <i>s-registers</i> labelled <code>$s0</code> through
<code>$s8</code>.  The s-registers can be thought of as containing
data that are typically stored in C variables.  Thus, in MIPS, operands
cannot be any variable, and there are only thirty-two 32-bit registers
(a memory location that holds 32 bits).  This conforms to the
following observation:

</p><blockquote>
<b>Design Principle #2:</b> <i>Smaller is faster.</i>
</blockquote>

Thus, in proper MIPS code, the preceding example would become:

<p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-ex2.gif"></p>

<h4>2.1.3. MIPS Memory</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Memory contains instructions and data specific to a
given program.  Instructions are fetched <i>automatically</i> by
control, while data is transferred <i>explicitly</i> between the
memory and processor.  Figure 2.4 shows an example of memory
operations in MIPS using the <code>lw</code> (load word) and
<code>sw</code> (store word) instructions.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/Figure2.4-MIPSmemory1.gif"><br><br>
<b>Figure 2.4.</b> Use of <code>lw</code> and <code>sw</code> instructions
to transfer data between memory and processor,
adapted from [Maf01].  
</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Here, data is organized in <i>linear memory</i> as a
stream of bits.  Each <i>byte</i> is comprised of eight contiguous
bits, and each <i>word</i> is comprised of four contiguous bytes. 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Data stored in memory is referenced using an
<i>address</i>, which is an identifier that points to a byte in
memory.  Addresses in MIPS range from 0 (which points to data in the
part of memory denoted as <code>M[0]</code>) up to 4,294,967,292
(referenced data is written as <code>M[2<sup>32</sup>]</code>).  Thus,
all addresses are 32 bits long, so 2<sup>30</sup> 32-bit (four-byte)
words are stored in MIPS memory.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Only load/store instructions can access data in
memory.  Since each word has length 4 bytes, the addresses referenced
by these instructions must be <i>aligned</i>, that is, all 32-bit
words start at addresses 0, 4, ..., 4n.  Because of differences
between computer manufacturers and the way different machines address
memory, the MIPS address formats have two types of encoding: <i>big
endian</i> and <i>little endian</i>, as shown in Figure 2.5.  Here, a
decimal (base-10) address of 3,101 is broken down into a
<i>hexadecimal</i> (base-16) address of (00 00 0c 1d)<sub>16</sub>.
Big endian stores the big part (00) at the top or beginning of the
address, and little endian is the reverse of big endian (stores (1d)
at the beginning of the address).

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/Figure2.5-Endians.gif"><br><br>
<b>Figure 2.5.</b> Example of big and little endian encoding,
adapted from [Maf01].  
</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">There are other interesting things you can do with
memory addressing, such as <i>offsets</i>.  For example, suppose you
wanted to add a number in memory location <code>A[2]</code> and put
the result in <code>A[0]</code>.  We know that <code>A[2]</code> has
the larger address, and this can be loaded using an offset of 8, as
shown in Figure 2.6.  Here, the register <code>$s1</code> represents
the <i>base address</i>, and the contents of the variable <i>h</i> are
stored in register <code>$s2</code>.

<h3>2.2. Instruction Representation</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mssz/CompOrg/PatHen-Readings.html#ExSec2.2"><b>Reading Assignments and Exercises</b></a> 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Computer instructions are based on three number systems:
decimal, binary, and hexadecimal.  Salient features of these systems 
include:

</p><ul><p></p><li><b>Binary</b>:

    <ul><p></p><li><i>Digits</i> = {0,1}  (Base 2)

        <p></p></li><li><i>Composition Rule</i> = (d<sub>n-1</sub>,
                    d<sub>n-2</sub>, ..., d<sub>1</sub>,
                    d<sub>0</sub>)<sub>2</sub> =&gt; d<sub>n-1</sub>
                    ยท 2<sup>n-1</sup> + d<sub>n-2</sub> ยท
                    2<sup>n-2</sup> + ... + d<sub>1</sub> ยท
                    2<sup>1</sup> + d<sub>0</sub> ยท 2<sup>0</sup>

        <p></p></li><li><i>Example</i> = (1010)<sub>2</sub> = 1 ยท 8 + 0
        ยท 4 + 1 ยท 2 + 0 ยท 1 = 8 + 2 = 10
    </li></ul>

        <p></p></li><li><b>Decimal</b>:

    <ul><p></p><li><i>Digits</i> = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}  (Base 10)

        <p></p></li><li><i>Composition Rule</i> = (d<sub>n-1</sub>,
                    d<sub>n-2</sub>, ..., d<sub>1</sub>,
                    d<sub>0</sub>)<sub>10</sub> =&gt; d<sub>n-1</sub>
                    ยท 10<sup>n-1</sup> + d<sub>n-2</sub> ยท
                    10<sup>n-2</sup> + ... + d<sub>1</sub> ยท
                    10<sup>1</sup> + d<sub>0</sub> ยท 10<sup>0</sup>

        <p></p></li><li><i>Example</i> = (2041)<sub>10</sub> = 1 ยท 1000 + 0
        ยท 100 + 4 ยท 10 + 1 ยท 1 = 2000 + 40 + 1 = 2,041
    </li></ul>

<p></p></li><li><b>Hexadecimal</b>:

    <ul><p></p><li><i>Digits</i> = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f}  (Base 16)

        <p></p></li><li><i>Composition Rule</i> = (d<sub>n-1</sub>,
                    d<sub>n-2</sub>, ..., d<sub>1</sub>,
                    d<sub>0</sub>)<sub>16</sub> =&gt; d<sub>n-1</sub>
                    ยท 16<sup>n-1</sup> + d<sub>n-2</sub> ยท
                    16<sup>n-2</sup> + ... + d<sub>1</sub> ยท
                    16<sup>1</sup> + d<sub>0</sub> ยท 16<sup>0</sup>

        <p></p></li><li><i>Example</i> = (c02a)<sub>16</sub> = 12 ยท
        16<sup>3</sup> + 0 ยท 16<sup>2</sup> + 2 ยท
        16<sup>1</sup> + 10 ยท 1 = 49,152 + 32 + 10 = 49,194
    </li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The basic operating concept of modern computers is
the <i>stored program</i>, by which programs can be loaded into
various partitions (blocks) of memory, then retrieved and loaded into
the processor.  In the preceding section, we noted that the CPU
control does this automatically.  In hardware, this is typically
accomplished by a device called an <i>instruction sequencer</i>.

</p><h4>2.2.1. Machine Language Instruction Format</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In machine language, all instructions have the same length.
In MIPS, this design compromise produces instructions that are 32 bits long.
The governing principle follows:

</p><blockquote>
<b>Design Principle #3:</b> <i>Good design demands good compromises.</i>
</blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">MIPS instructions have three different formats:

</p><ol><p></p><li><i>R format</i> - Arithmetic instructions
    <p></p></li><li><i>I format</i> - Branch, transfer, and immediate instructions
    <p></p></li><li><i>J format</i> - Jump instructions
</li></ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">These formats are further explained in Figure 2.7.
Note that jump instructions merely transfer control (execution) to the
specified memory address.  As a result, J-format instructions are not
very interesting, so we will concentrate the remainder of
discussion in this section on R- and I-format instructions.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/Figure2.7-MIPSinstrFmt.gif"><br><br>
<b>Figure 2.7.</b> MIPS instruction format,
adapted from [Maf01].
</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 1.</b> Consider an example of an
R-format instruction <code>add $t0 $s1 $s2</code>, which means that we
add two numbers stored in C registers 1 and 2 (<code>$s1</code> and
<code>$s2</code>), then put the result in temporary register 0
(<code>$t0</code>).  Here, <code>$t0</code> has the address <code>8</code>,
and the C-registers have the addresses <code>17</code> and <code>18</code>.
The "$" sign means <i>contents-of</i>.  For example <code>$18</code> means
<i>contents of register whose address is 18</i>.  Also, note that the
order of the operands in the machine language instruction (ones and zeros)
is different than in the assembly-language version.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPSaddInstr-Ex1.gif"></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Important Note.</b> MIPS has several register
conventions that you should know, which are summarized in the
following table.  These conventions will be observed as we progress
toward more involved MIPS programs.

</p><p align="CENTER"><b>Table 2.1.</b> MIPS Register Conventions, adapted
from [Maf01]<br> <img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/Table2.1-MIPSregisters.gif"></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 2.</b> A slightly different example of an
R-format instruction involves subtraction - <code>sub $t1 $s1
$s2</code>, which means that we add two numbers stored in C registers
1 and 2 (<code>$s1</code> and <code>$s2</code>), then put the result
in temporary register 1 (<code>$t1</code>).  Here, <code>$t1</code>
has the address <code>9</code>, and the C-registers have the addresses
<code>17</code> and <code>18</code>, as before.  Note that the
<code>funct</code> code for subtraction (34) is different from that
for addition (32), and that there is no shifting.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPSaddInstr-Ex2.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 3.</b> Consider an example of an
I-format instruction that involves loading a word - <code>lw $t0
52($s3) </code>, which means that we load a word into register
<code>$t0</code>, which has address 8, by fetching the data from
memory location <code>$s3</code>, which has address 19, with an offset
of 52.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPSloadInstr-Ex1.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 4.</b> Another example of an 
I-format instruction involves storing a word - <code>sw $t0
52($s3)</code>, which is the opposite of the instruction in  
Example 3.  Note that the opcode for store (43) is
different from that for load (35), and that the addresses are
kept the same, for simplicity.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPSloadInstr-Ex2.gif"></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We next assemble these concepts together to show how
an instruction is translated from a high-level language to assembly
language, and thence to machine language.

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 5.</b> Given the high-level
statement <code>A[300] = h + A[300];</code> the following
translation sequence holds:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPScompile-Ex1.gif"></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Note that <code>A[300]</code> is stored in memory
with an offset of 1200.  This is due to the 32-bit word length (four
bytes) that we discussed in Section 2.1.  Since memory is structured
as a linear array of bytes, to obtain the correct byte offset to
maintain word alignment, we need to multiply the memory location in
source code by the word length (e.g., byte offset 1200 = word 300
ยท 4 bytes/word).

</p><h4>2.2.3. Special Cases</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Thus far, we have overviewed the basic add, sub, load,
and store instructions.  However, MIPS has several special cases of these
instructions, which are designed to make programs run much faster.  We
consider these special cases, as follows.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>2.2.3.1. Addition of Constants.</b> By analyzing
large bodies of source code (also called <i>corpi</i>, the plural of
<i>corpus</i>), the developers of MIPS were able to determine that
small constants are used frequently and comprise approximately 50
percent of operands.  For example, <code>A = A + 5;</code> and <code>C
= D - 1;</code> respectively are common types of <i>increment</i> or
<i>decrement</i> statements.  In general, if an event occurs 50
percent or more of the time, then it is called the <i>common case</i>,
and the following principle applies:

</p><blockquote>
<b>Design Principle #4:</b> <i>Make the common case fast.</i>
</blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As a result of this concept, MIPS puts typical
constants in memory and loads them into special <i>hardwired</i>
registers (e.g., <code>$0</code>).

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 6.</b> Consider the following <i>add
immediate</i> instruction for addition of a register and a constant
(I-format):

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPSaddInstr-Ex3.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Here, the contents of C-register <code>$s7</code> are
added to the constant 4 and put into the temporary register
<code>$t0</code>.  The constant 4 is represented at the right-hand
part of the instruction as a two-byte (16-bit) value.  The opcode for
<code>addi</code> is 8, which is different from the <code>add</code>
instruction's opcode (per Example 1, above).  As in our previous
examples, <code>$t0</code> has the address 7, and it is readily
determined that <code>$s7</code> has the address 23.
</p></blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>2.2.3.2. Overflow.</b> Compilers have limited
precision (usually 32 bits).  If a result of an addition or
multiplication is a number that requires a binary representation
larger than 32 bits, then we have a problem.  We call this situation
<i>register overflow</i>, because the number to be loaded into the
register is larger (i.e., has more bits) than the register can
accomodate.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Some high-level languages (e.g., Ada and certain Fortran
compilers) detect overflow, while others (e.g., C) do not.  MIPS
provides two types of arithmetic instructions:

</p><ol><p></p><li><i>add, sub, addi</i> cause overflow; while

    <p></p></li><li><i>addu, subu, addiu</i> do not cause overflow.
</li></ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">MIPS C compilers produce <code>addu</code>,
<code>subu</code>, and <code>addiu</code> instructions by default,
thereby extending the ANSI standard C language specification.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>2.2.3.3. Logical Operations.</b> In MIPS, a
logical constant is expressed as a vector of 32 ones and zeroes,
not as an integer number.  This leads to the practice of <i>bitwise
logical operations</i> that operate in parallel upon a vector of
Boolean numbers, for example:

</p><p align="CENTER">(0010 0001 0100) = (0010 0001 0110) <i>and</i> (1010 0011 0101)
</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In MIPS instructions <i>and</i> and <i>or</i>, the
operands are registers, and the R-format instruction is used (similar
to the <i>add</i> instruction in Example 1, above).  In contrast, MIPS
instructions <code>andi</code> and <code>ori</code> have operands that
are immediates, and the I-format instruction is used. An example of
the I-format logical instruction follows.

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 7.</b> Consider the following <code>andi</code> 
instruction for and-ing a register and a logical constant (a Boolean
number):

</p><p align="CENTER"><b>andi $t0, $t0, 0xFFF</b><br>
<img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPSlogicalInstr-Ex1.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This instruction has several interesting
characteristics.  The first operand is stored in register t0, and is
<i>and</i>ed with a logical constant specified in hexadecimal as
0xFFF.  This representation means <i>fill the word with zeroes until
you get to the last three digits, which are f, f, and f</i>.  Since
F<sub>16</sub> = (1111)<sub>2</sub>, we have the second operand shown
above.  When the logical <i>and</i> operation is applied bitwise to
these operands, the result is shown below the line.  Note that the
word 0xFFF is called a <i>mask</i> because <i>and</i>ing causes the
result to be zero (one) in those bit positions where the mask has the
value of zero (resp. one).
</p></blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>2.2.3.4. Shift Instructions.</b> In order to move
the contents of a register to the left or right efficiently, MIPS has
a dedicated shift capability that is controlled by the following
<i>shift instructions</i>:

</p><ul><p></p><li><i>sll</i> (shift left logical): fills empty bits with zeroes

    <p></p></li><li><i>srl</i> (shift right logical): fills empty bits with zeroes

    <p></p></li><li><i>sra</i> (shift right arithmetic): sign extends empty bits
</li></ul>

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 8.</b> Assume that the R-format
instruction <code><b>srl $t0, $s1, 8</b></code> is applied as shown
below.  The <i>shift amount</i>, represented as <i>shamt</i>, is
the number of bits to shift the operand <code>$s1</code> to yield the
result in <code>$t0</code>.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPSshiftInstr-Ex1.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Since the instruction is R-format, note that the opcode
is modified by the <i>funct</i> descriptor (000010) that occupies the
last six bits of the instruction.  Shift instructions are used for a
wide variety of operations, including the pencil-and-paper algorithm
for multiplication of binary numbers.
</p></blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>2.2.3.5. Multiplication and Division.</b> We will
discuss multiplication and division in MIPS in detail in Section 3.3.  
For now, consider the following information as useful in the context of the
MIPS instruction format.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Multiplication and division of two N-bit numbers
produce a result that can be as large as 2N significant digits (i.e.,
2N bits).  As a result, MIPS uses two registers, called <i>hi</i> and
<i>lo</i>, to store the upper and lower parts of the product (for
multiplication) as well as the remainder and quotient (for division).

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 9.</b> Assume that <code><b>mult $s0,
$s1</b></code> produces the product of registers <code>s0</code> and
<code>s1</code>.  In order to get the high and low part of the product
into 32-bit registers <code>s2</code> and <code>s3</code>, so the product can
be further manipulated, the following instructions would be used:

</p><pre>        mfhi $s2
        mflo $s3
</pre>
            
</blockquote>

<h4>2.2.4. Assembly vs. Machine Language</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Assembly language is a convenient symbolic notation
that is much easier to write and understand than a stream of ones and
zeroes (machine language).  In MIPS assembly language notation, the
destination (result) is first in the operand list.  This is generally
the convention for the vast majority of assembly languages. 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In contrast, machine language is the underlying
reality of program representation (bit stream) that is fed into
the processor.  Each machine language instruction has the destination
(result) register in the last position.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Although assembly language can provide convenient
pseudo-instructions, it is the machine language instruction that is
actually executed.

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Important Note:</b> When counting instructions to
calculate the instruction count (IC) of a given program, count
<i>machine language instructions</i>, since they are the only
instructions executed.  If you count assembly language instructions,
then you will have an IC that is misleadingly small, since one
assembly language instruction can be translated to several machine
language instructions.

<p align="JUSTIFY">This concludes our overview of MIPS instruction
format.  We next examine how the MIPS architecture supports 
decision instructions and procedures.

</p><h3>2.3. Decision Instructions and Procedure Support</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mssz/CompOrg/PatHen-Readings.html#ExSec2.3"><b>Reading Assignments and Exercises</b></a> 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Decision instructions express
<i>control flow</i> in computer program execution.  Important
types of decision instructions include:

</p><ul><p></p><li><i>Conditional Branch</i> such as <code>if-then</code>
           or <code>if-then-else</code>

    <p></p></li><li><i>Loops</i> such as <code>while</code>, <code>do-while</code>,
           and <code>for</code>

    <p></p></li><li><i>Inequalities</i> that form the basis of <i>logical predicates</i>

    <p></p></li><li><i>Switch Statements</i> that allow one to choose among multiple
           evaluations of a given variable
</li></ul>

<h4>2.3.1. Conditional Branches</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Conditional branch instructions in MIPS have the
following format:

</p><p align="CENTER"><code><b>opcode</b> register1, register2,
destination_address</code></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">where <i>opcode</i> is either <code>beq</code>
(branch on equality) or <code>bne</code> (branch on inequality).
These instructions compare the contents of <code>register1</code> and
<code>register2</code> to determine if they are equal.  If equal (not
equal), then <code>beq</code> (<code>bne</code>) transfers control to
<code>destination_address</code>.  Otherwise, control is transferred
to the next instruction in the machine language instruction sequence.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">MIPS decision instructions have the machine language
format described in Section 2.2 of these notes.  An example follows.

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 1.</b> Suppose we have the following MIPS
assembly language instruction:

</p><p align="CENTER"><code>beq $s3, $s4, 20</code></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The registers have addresses 19 and 20, the opcode is
4 (for <i>beq</i>) and the destination address is 5 (the 20th byte is
in the fifth word, since each word is 4 bytes long).  Thus, we have:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPSbeq-Ex1.gif"></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In MIPS, there is no need to calculate the addresses for
branches - the assembler does this for you, as shown in the following
example.  

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 2.</b> Suppose we have the following high-level
language code:

</p><pre>       if (i == j) go to L1;
       f = g + h;
  L1:  f = f - i;
</pre>

<p>where register assignments are:

</p><pre>    f =&gt; $s0 , g =&gt; $s1 , h =&gt; $s2
    i =&gt; $s3 , j =&gt; $s4
</pre>

<p>The corresponding MIPS assembly code is as follows:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPSbeq-Ex2.gif"></p>
</blockquote>

<h4>2.3.2. Jump Instruction</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The MIPS <i>jump</i> instruction functions like the
<i>go to</i> instruction in C, that is, control is transferred to a
specific destination address in memory.  The instruction format is
either of the following two forms:

</p><pre>      j  <b>label</b>
      j  <b>destination_address</b>
</pre>

<p>where <i>label</i> is shown as "L1" in Example 2 of Section 2.3.1.
Here, <i>label</i> is a string and <i>destination_address</i> is a
numberical constant within the range of permissible MIPS address
values.

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 3.</b> Suppose we have the following assembly
language code:

</p><pre>      j 1024
</pre>

<p>The corresponding MIPS machine language representation follows:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPSjump-Ex1.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As before, the machine language address representation
is calculated as 256 = 1024 bytes / 4 bytes/word.

</p><p align="CENTER"><code>beq $s3, $s4, 20</code></p>
</blockquote>

<h4>2.3.3. If Statements</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The purpose of an <i>if</i> statement is to provide
conditional transfer of control to one or more blocks of statements,
one of which is executed when its corresponding condition coded in the
if-statement is satisfied.  The if-statement can be implemented using
the infamous <i>go to</i> statement, as shown in Figure 2.8.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/Figure2.8-ifstmt1.gif"><br><br>
<b>Figure 2.8.</b> Implementation of an <i>if</i> statement in
terms of high-level language using the <i>go to</i> statement,
adapted from [Maf01].
</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 4.</b> Suppose we want to translate an
if-statement from high-level language into MIPS assembly language.
According to the method of Figure 2.8, this would be done as follows:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-ifstmt-Ex1.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Note:</i> There is a mistake in this figure - the
third MIPS statement (<code>j Fin</code>) should read (<code>j
False</code>).
</p></blockquote>

<h4>2.3.4. Loop Statements</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Loop statements include <i>for</i>, <i>while</i>,
and <i>do-while</i> control structures.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>2.3.4.1. For-loops.</b> A simple iterative
structure is the <i>for-loop</i>, which has the following form:

</p><pre>     for <b>index</b> = <b>base</b> to <b>target</b> by <b>increment</b>
         ...statements to be executed...
     endfor
</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">where <i>index</i> is a counter to be incremented,
<i>base</i> (<i>target</i>) is the starting (ending) value for
<i>index</i>, and <i>increment</i> is the step value that is added to
<i>index</i> each time control passes through the loop.  The for-loop is
implemented in terms of the <i>go to</i> statement, as follows:

</p><pre>          <b>index</b> = <b>base</b> 
   Loop:  ...statements to be executed...
          <b>index</b> = <b>index</b> + <b>increment</b>
          if <b>index</b> is greater than or equal to <b>target</b> goto Fin
          else goto Loop
   Fin:
</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This can be translated to MIPS assembly language,
as shown in the following example.

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 5.</b> Consider the translation of a loop
from the preceding high-level language <i>go-to</i> format into
MIPS assembly language, as shown in Figure 2.9.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/Figure2.9-loop1.gif"><br><br>
<b>Figure 2.9.</b> Implementation of a <i>loop</i> statement in
terms of MIPS assembly language using the <i>go to</i> statement,
with register assignments shown on the left - 
adapted from [Maf01].
</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Note that the first three assembly instructions set
the value of <code>$t1</code>, which holds the address of the memory
element A[i].  The register <code>$t0</code> stores the value A[i]
that is in the i-th memory element, while g is the accumulator
variable and i represents the loop index.  The last MIPS statement
implements the <i>loopback</i> which branches to the label
<code>Loop</code> if the index i is less than the value h, which is
stores in register <code>$s2</code>.
</p></blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>2.3.4.2. While-loops.</b> A variation of the for-loop
is the <i>while-loop</i>, which makes the execution of statements within
the body of the loop contingent on the satisfaction of a condition.  The
while-loop has the following form in high-level language:

</p><pre>     while (<b>condition</b>)
       ...statements to be executed... ;
</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">where <i>condition</i> is a logical predicate that
evaluates to <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>.  In each iteration of the
loop, the while-loop first checks to see if <i>condition</i> is true.
If <i>condition</i> evaluates to <i>false</i>, then the loop exits.
Otherwise, the statements in the body of the loop are executed.

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 6.</b> Consider the translation of a while-loop
from the high-level language format to 
MIPS assembly language, as shown in Figure 2.10.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Here, the first three MIPS statements establish the
loop index, which in turn establishes the address of the memory
element save[i]. (Note that "save" is being used instead of "M", to
accustom you to the use of different variables to describe stored
data.)  In the fourth MIPS statement, the condition (save[i] != k) is
checked to see if it is time to exit the loop by transferring control
to the label <code>Exit</code>.  This is done using the
<code>bne</code> operation.  The sixth statement comprises the body of
the loop, where the variable i is incremented by the amount j.  The
final MIPS statement implements loopback.
</p></blockquote>

<p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/Figure2.10-while.gif"><br><br>
<b>Figure 2.10.</b> Implementation of a <i>while</i> statement in
terms of MIPS assembly language using the <i>jump</i> statement,
with register assignments shown in bold type at the top of the
lower box, adapted from [Maf01].
</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Analysis.</b> It is useful to examine the code in
Figure 2.10.  A cursory technique is to calculate the number N of
MIPS assembly instructions executed if save[i + m * j] does not equal
k (for m = 10), or if save[i+m*j] = k (for m between 0 and 9).  In
that case, there are 7 instructions executed per iteration of the loop
(i = 0 to i = 9), plus five instructions executed when control exits
the loop (because branch to <code>Exit</code> is the fifth MIPS
instruction).  Thus, N = 10(7) + 5 = 75 instructions.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Note</i>: This technique of cursory analysis is
acceptable in this case, because there happens to be a one-to-one
correspondence between assembly and machine language instructions.
However, if there were more machine language instructions than
assembly instructions, then we would have to modify the number 7 in
the equation N \ 10(7) + 5, to reflect that.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Optimization.</b> There is a way to make the
MIPS program in Figure 2.10 run faster, which we call <i>partial
loop unrolling</i>.  This involves repeating part of the loop
body outside the loop itself, thereby allowing one to write fewer
statements inside the loop.  The result appears as follows:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-while-optz-Ex1.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Here, we have removed one statement from the body
of the loop shown in Figure 2.10 by moving the initial loop setup
operations and initial test for <i>condition</i> to a location
before the loopback point (label <code>Loop</code>).  This allows
us to remove the <code>j Loop</code> statement from Figure 2.10,
combining it with the <code>beq</code> statement.  

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">This partial unrolling of the loop contents and
reordering of the loop statements results in only six statements
per iteration of the loop, but there are still five statements in
the loop setup (before the <code>Loop</code> label).  As a result,
we have N = 10(6) + 5 = 65 statements, instead of 75, to perform
the same function as Figure 2.10.  This results in a relative
performance gain of 75/65 = 1.154, so the optimized code is 15.4
percent faster than the code in Figure 2.10.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>2.3.4.3. Dowhile Loops.</b> A variation of the 
while loop is the <i>dowhile</i> loop.  This loop has a <i>postcondition</i>
that is evaluated after executing the statements in the loop body,
rather than the <i>precondition</i> of the while loop.  The general
form of the dowhile loop in high-level language is:

</p><pre>do {...statements...} while <b>condition</b></pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">where <i>condition</i> is a logical predicate.
On the first iteration of the loop, the statements in the body of
the loop are executed regardless of whether <i>condition</i> is
true or false.  Then, <i>condition</i> is checked, as it is at 
the end of every iteration thereafter.

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 7.</b> Figure 2.11 shows the high-level
language representation of a simple do-while statement (in the
upper left quadrant of the figure), followed by the implementation
in terms of <i>go-to</i> statement (upper right).  The register
assignment (lower left) references the MIPS assembly code 
(large box at lower right).

presented in the preceding section to make this loop more efficient?

an exam question.)

</p></blockquote>

<h4>2.3.5. Inequalities</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In practice, algorithms and computer programs need to
compare values using inequalities such as (&lt;) and (&gt;).  In MIPS,
such comparison is implemented via the <i>set on less-than</i> instruction,
called <code>slt</code> or <code>slti</code>. The MIPS
assembly instruction has the following format:

</p><p align="CENTER"><code>slt register1 register2 register3</code> ,</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">and implements a comparison operation that has the following
functionality (in high-level pseudocode):

</p><pre>       if <b>register2 &lt; register3</b> then
           <b>register1 = 1</b>
       else
           <b>register1 = 0</b>
       endif
</pre>

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 8.</b> Suppose we want to program the
following high-level code fragment in MIPS assembly language:

</p><pre>       if (g &lt; h) then goto Less ;</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The following MIPS assembly code suffices:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-slt-Ex1.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The first statement places the value 1 in register
<code>$t0</code> if register <code>$s0</code> &lt; register
<code>$s1</code>, and a zero otherwise.  The second statement tests
whether or not there is a nonzero value in register <code>$t0</code>,
by comparing it with the zero value stored in the register
<code>$0</code>.  If the test for inequality fails (i.e., there is a
zero in register <code>$t0</code>), then control is passed to the next
statement.  Otherwise, control is passed to the instruction in memory
referenced by the label <code>Less</code>.
</p></blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">An alternate form of the <code>slt</code> instruction
is <code>slti</code> (<i>set on less-than, immediate mode</i>), which
allows comparison of register contents with a constant value that is
hardcoded into the assembly language instruction.  The
<code>slti</code> instruction has the following format:

</p><pre>        slti register1, register2, <b>constant</b></pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">where <i>constant</i> is a hardcoded constant value. 

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 9.</b> The <i>slti</i> instruction is
useful in loops.  For example, if g is a loop index, and we
want to implement the following high-level code fragment:

</p><pre>        if (g &gt;= 1) goto Loop; </pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">then the following MIPS instructions would be employed:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-slti-Ex1.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Here, the first instruction says that register
<code>$t0</code> = 1 if g &lt; 1, where the constant 1 is hardcoded
into the instruction (hence, the use of <i>immediate</i> addressing).
The second instruction transfers control to the label
<code>Loop</code> if g is greater than or equal to 1.
</p></blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">For unsigned number representations, which we shall
discuss later in this course, the <code>sltu</code> and
<code>sltiu</code> instructions are employed.  These function
similarly to <code>slt</code> and <code>slti</code>.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Relational operators other than <i>equals</i> and
<i>not-equals</i> are unsupported in MIPS assembler.  Instead, the
following constructs can be used to create assembly language
representations of the remaining relations:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-slt-Ex2.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We call these <i>pseudoinstructions</i> because while
they are not directly supported by the MIPS assembler, they can be
constructed from other MIPS assembly language instructions.

</p><h4>2.3.6. Case and Switch Statements</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The high-level language statements called <i>case</i>
or <i>switch</i> select a statement or group of statements to be
executed based on the value of a key variable.  In Figure 2.12, the
high-level code is expressed in terms of the C-language <i>switch</i>
statement (upper left-hand box).  The arrow pointing down to the
<i>if</i> statement (lower left-hand box) shows how the <i>switch</i>
statement is translated into a series of <i>if</i> statements, which
we already know how to implement in MIPS assembly language (per
Section 2.3.3).  The assembly code is shown in the right-hand box.

MIPS assembly language, with register assignments shown at the top of the 
right-hand box - adapted from [Maf01].
</p>

<h4>2.3.7. Jump Tables</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is possible to store in memory the addresses of
machine language instructions to which control is to be transferred
(for example, by a conditional branch).  Thus, let a <i>jump table</i>
be comprised of registers that contain the memory addresses of machine
language instructions that are referenced by labels L0 through L3.  We
use the MIPS instruction called <code>jr</code> (for <i>jump
register</i> to implement the jump to the address contained in a given
register that is referenced by the <code>jr</code> instruction.
Figure 2.13 illustrates this process.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/Figure2.13-jumptbl.gif"><br><br> <b>Figure

MIPS assembly language, with register assignments shown at the top of the 
right-hand box - adapted from [Maf01].
</p>

<h4>2.3.8. Procedure Support</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In order to run programs that are comprised of
multiple procedures, the MIPS ISA must support memory mapping and
C or C-like function definitions and encapsulation, as well as
stack-based execution and some type of compilation.  In this section,
we discuss these concepts and how they are implemented in MIPS.
 
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>2.3.8.1. Memory Map.</b> In order to keep the
storage of data and instructions for a given program orderly, MIPS
uses the memory map illustrated schematically in Figure 2.14.  Here,
there is a 4MB reserved space starting at hexadeciaml address
0x00000000 to the text segment, which starts at 0x00400000.  The
reserved space is used for system bookkeeping and other functions,
while the text segment stores a program's instructions.
 
</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/Figure2.14-MIPSmemory.gif"><br><br>
<b>Figure 2.14.</b> Layout of memory in MIPS architecture, where
<code>$gp</code> denotes <i>global pointer</i> - adapted from [Maf01].
You can read about this further in Section A.5 of your textbook
[Pat98].
</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The data segment begins at 0x10000000 and is divided
into two parts.  The static data segment contains objects whose size
is known to the compiler and whose lifetime extends throughout the
program's execution.  By <i>lifetime</i>, we mean the interval during
which a program can access data.  In contrast, dynamic data is
allocated by the program as it executes.  For example, the C
<code>malloc</code> function allocates memory dynamically by finding
and returning a new block of memory using operating system utilities.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The program stack segment resides at the top of the
address space, starting at 0x7FFFFFFF.  The stack is a dynamic
structure that stores values generated by different operations
throughout the course of a program's execution.  Since the contents of
the stack are not known at compile time, the stack size varies, hence
the large memory space alloted to it.
 
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">This three-part division of memory (text, data, and
stack segments) has the advantage that the dynamically expandable
segments (dynamic data and stack) are as far apart as possible, but
are positioned to use the entire program's address space, if necessary.
 
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>2.3.8.2. Data Segment.</b> Two instructions
(<code>lui</code> and <code>lw</code>) are needed to access the data
segment, as shown in Figure 2.15.  To avoid repeating the <code>lui</code> insturction at every load and store, MIPS typically dedicates a register called
<code>$gp</code> (global pointer) to the static data segment.  This register
contains address 1000080000<sub>16</sub>, so load and store instructions
can use their signed 16-bit offset fields to access the first 64KB of
the static data segment.  

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/Figure2.15-DataSegment.gif"><br><br> <b>Figure
2.15.</b> Accessing an entry in the data segment, adapted from [Maf01].
</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Figure 2.15 illustrates the rewriting of the instruction
pair

</p><pre>        lui $s0, 0x1001
        lw  $v0, 0x8020($s0)
</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">using the global pointer, as the single instruction

</p><pre>        lw  $v0, 0x8020($gp)
</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Additionally, $gp renders more efficient the
addressing of locations 10000000<sub>16</sub> through
10010000<sub>16</sub> than other heap locations.  MIPS compiler
usually stores global scalar variables in this area because these
variables have fixed locations and fit better than other global data
such as arrays.  (The scalars are smaller and can thus be packed
more efficiently into limited memory space.)
 
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>2.3.8.3. Support for C Functions and
Procedures.</b> The C language (and many other high level languages)
are modularly structured, being comprised of numerous functions,
procedures, or subroutines.  These functions are called from the
main program, and can be called by each other, leading to a transfer
of control that is diagrammed with arrows in Figure 2.16.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/Figure2.16-Cprocs.gif"><br><br> <b>Figure
2.16.</b> Calling sequence in C, adapted from [Maf01].
</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A key implementational question pertains to the
bookkeeping information that the compiler must keep track of.  In the
C calling sequence as implemented in MIPS, the following information
is accounted for:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-callinfo.gif"></p>
 
<p align="JUSTIFY">The procedure address includes the labels that
reference the procedure, and their addresses.  The return address
points to the location in memory that control is transferred to
<i>after</i> the called procedure completes.  The argument registers
contain the values referenced by the formal arguments of the called
procedure.  The return values are what is returned by the called
procedure through the <code>return</code> statement when the procedure
completes.  If the called procedure is declared a <code>void</code> procedure,
then $v0 and $v1 are empty.  As discussed previously $s0 through
$s7 are used to store values referenced by variables that are local
to (within the scope of) the called procedure.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Because procedures are dynamic, <i>procedure call
frames</i> (PCFs) are used to store this bookkeeping information.
Typically a PCF contains arguments, save registers, and local
variables.  If a machine has a small number of registers, then the
state <i>S</i> of the registers must be saved prior to calling a
subordinate procedure.  Otherwise, the calling procedure or program's
state will be obliterated.  After the called procedure completes, then
the machine is restored to <i>S</i>, augmented by the values returned
by the called procedure.  The register conventions shown in Table 2.1
apply to called procedures (termed <i>callees</i>) as well as to the
calling procedure or program.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>2.3.8.4. The Stack.</b> The stack is where the
stack frames, also termed <i>Procedure Call Frames</i> or PCFs, are
temporarily stored in memory.  The stack begins at address 0xFFFFFFFF
and can be expanded upward.  However, 0xFFFFFFFF up to 0x7FFFFFFF
is reserved space.  Thus, the stack frame corresponding to the main
program begins at 0x7FFFFFFF, as shown in Figure 2.17a.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/Figure2.17a-Stack.gif"><br>(a)<br> <img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/Figure2.17b-StackFrame.gif"><br>(b)<br><br> <b>Figure 2.17.</b>
(a) MIPS stack and (b) stack frames for called procedure, adapted from
[Maf01].
</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In Figure 2.17b is shown the stack with the main
program's stack frame and the called procedure (callee) frame.  In
this case, the callee frame ranges from address <code>$fp</code> to
<code>$sp</code> (the stack pointer, which points to the furthest
extent of the stack).  The argument registers ($a...) and the return
value registers ($v...) are stored in the callee's stack frame.  Extra
arguments that cannot be stored in <code>$a0</code> through
<code>$a3</code> are stored in the calling procedure's stack frame.
Additionally, memory locations that store the calling program's
(caller) state are referenced by their addresses stored in the
caller's stack frame (denoted by VAT in Figure 2.17b).

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The following process occurs when a procedure is called:

<p align="JUSTIFY">We can better understand this sequence of operations if
we analyze a simple example.

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 10.</b> Consider the following example
of a program that calls an addition function <code>sum(x,y)</code>:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-ProcSupp1.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Here, the first two <code>add</code> instructions put
the arguments of <code>sum</code> into the argument registers
<code>$a0</code> and <code>$a1</code>.  Then, the return address is
set at 1016, the address of the instruction after the subsequent jump.
The jump instruction jumps to the <i>label</i> <code>sum</code>, which
is references memory address 2000.  Here, the local variables x and y,
whose values are stored in the argument registers <code>$a0</code> and
<code>$a1</code>, are added and the result put in the return register
<code>$v0</code>.  Then, the instruction <code>jr</code> (jump
register) is executed to pass control to the return address
(<code>$ra</code> = 1016, which was set in the third instruction).
</p></blockquote>
 
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Alternate Approach.</b> The preceding process can
be made more efficient by eliminating one instruction in favor of the
<code>jal</code> (jump and link) instruction.  This should actually be
called the <i>link and jump</i> instruction, since it automatically
stores the address of the next instruction in $ra, then jumps to the
label specified in the instruction syntax:

</p><p align="CENTER"><code>jal <b>label</b></code></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Jump and link is a J-format instruction, which would
be used in the preceding example to implement the following code:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-ProcSupp2.gif"></p>

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="BLUE"><b>Self-Exercise.</b> In the 
preceding example, all other things being equal, what is the
efficiency realized by substituting the <code>jal</code> instruction
for the <code>j</code> instruction?  Justify your answer quantitatively.
</font>
</p></blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The <code>jal</code> instruction is also useful for
nested procedures, where one procedure is called from inside another.
The following code fragment is illustrative:

</p><pre><b>       int sumSquare(int x, int y) {
         return mult(x,x) + y;
      }</b>
</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This code fragment is rendered in MIPS assembler as follows:
 
</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-ProcNest.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Here, instead of using addition instructions to store
values in registers, we use <i>load</i> and <i>store</i> instructions
to perform very fast memory I/O to save and restore variables.  The
boxed instructions show how arguments are the return address are saved
in a very efficient manner.  The addition instructions require the ALU
to be activated - load and store do not require the ALU, which is much
slower than register I/O.  Since we perform many I/O operations for
procedure calls, mainly in saving and restoring the procedure state
via the stack frame, we want to <i>make the common case fast</i> and
use the most efficient means of handling arguments and jump addresses
that we possibly can.
 
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>2.3.8.5. Stack and Recursion.</b> The final
perversion of the previous development sequence (procedures =&gt;
multiple calls =&gt; nested procedures) occurs when we have
<i>recursion</i>, where a procedure can call itself many times (in
the worst case, infinitely).  This causes a large number of procedure
call frames to be stored on the stack. It is thus possible to run out
of stack space.  We call that undesireable condition <i>stack
overflow</i>.  There are several ways to avoid stack overflow,
including virtual memory (paging stack contents to disk), which we
will discuss later in this course.  In the meantime, consider the
following example.
 
</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 11.</b> Recall that the factorial of a
number N can be computed as

</p><p align="CENTER">N! = N ยท (N-1) ยท (N-2) ยท ... ยท 2 ยท 1 . </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Thus, the factorial is recursive.  As a result, a
routine <code>fact(x)</code> that computes the factorial of its
integer argument x could be written as:

</p><p align="CENTER"><code>fact(x) = x</code> ยท <code>fact(x-1)</code>
ยท <code>fact(x-2)</code> ยท ... ยท 1 . </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">This implies the following C code for the factorial
function:

</p><pre><b>        main(){
           int f;
           f = fact(10);
           printf("Fact(10 = %d\n",f);
        }

        int fact(int n){
           if (n &lt; 1)
              return(1);
           else
              return(n * fact(n-1));
        }</b>
</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As a result, the stack will be loaded with stack
frame for the <code>main()</code> routine, followed by the stack
frames for <code>fact(10)</code>, <code>fact(9)</code>, ...,
<code>fact(1)</code>, in that order, as shown in Figure 2.18a.  This
is a representation of the stack when the recursion is "wound up",
i.e., all the calls to <code>fact(n)</code> have been made.  Then, the
stack is "wound down" by evaluating each call to <code>fact(n)</code>,
using the stack frames pushed onto the stack when the stack was wound
up.  Thus, the calls to <code>fact</code> will be evaluated in the order
<code>fact(1)</code>, <code>fact(2)</code>, ..., <code>fact(10)</code>,
followed by the evaluation of the remainder of the <code>main</code>
procedure.  This is done by (1) popping the stack frame for a given
call off the stack, (2) evaluating the call, then (3) going back to the
stack for the next stack frame.  When the stack is empty, the program
has been evaluated.  The MIPS assembly code for this process is shown
in Figure 2.18b.

<p align="JUSTIFY">In summary, MIPS has several conventions that make
procedure calls feasible.  First, the callee can use VAT registers
freely.  Second, the caller can use the S-registers without having
his values overwritten.  Third, you can use the stack to save your
data or instruction addresses, provided that you leave it the way
you found it (i.e., pop off the things you pushed onto the stack
after you are done using the stack).  Fourth, the register conventions
should be observed, to keep memory access consistent.  Fifth, MIPS
provides instruction support in terms of the <code>jal</code> and
<code>jr</code> instructions, where <code>jal</code> operates on a 
label, and <code>jr</code> operates on a register (e.g., $ra).

</p><h3>2.4. Number Representations, Data Types and Addressing  </h3>

<p><a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mssz/CompOrg/PatHen-Readings.html#ExSec2.4"><b>Reading Assignments and Exercises</b></a> 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In this section, we discuss theoretical and practical
foundations for representing numbers in digital computers, including
MIPS.  We then show how different types of data are represented and
referenced (via addresses) in MIPS.  
 
</p><h4>2.4.1. Number Representations</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In Section 1, we showed how different number systems
(e.g., binary, decimal, hexadecimal) could be used interchangeably to
represent a wide range of integers.  Computers used <i>fixed precision
number representation</i>.  This means that if a number can be
represented using N binary digits, then the range of possible values
for that representation is -2<sup>N-1</sup> to 2<sup>N-1</sup> - 1.
 
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Because of the precision problem, the laws of 
continuous algebra do not always hold in computer arithmetic.
We will shortly see why this is so.  First, let us consider issues
associated with computer representations.  Note that bits can be 
used to represent anything - text, characters, images, colors, etc.
However, N bits can only be used to represent a maximum of 2<sup>N</sup>
distinct (unique) objects.  
 
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>2.4.1.1. Signed Magnitude Encoding.</b> Number
representations in binary arithmetic tend to be problematic if you
want to represent negative numbers and zero.  For example, one can
used <i>signed magnitude encoding</i>, which represents a number
(e.g., -37) as a binary number (e.g., 1x0100101).  Here the minus sign
is represented by a leading 1.  If a positive number is thus
represented, the leading digit is zero.  (Note that the leading digit
is called the <i>most significant bit</i> or MSB.)  The problem with
signed magnitude representations is that there are two representations
for zero, namely -0 (1x0000) and +0 (0x0000). This makes arithmetic
circuits compilcated.  Hence, signed magnitude encoding was abandoned
early in the development of computer arithmetic.
 
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>2.4.1.2. Ones Complement Encoding.</b> Numbers can
be encoded using <i>ones complement</i>, which makes arithmetic
circuits simpler.  For example, 7<sub>10</sub> = 00111<sub>2</sub>,
but -7<sub>10</sub> = 11000<sub>2</sub>.  Thus, positive numbers have
leading zeroes, while negative numbers have leading ones.  Unfortunately,
there are still two zero representations (0x0000 and 0x11111).

</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>2.4.1.3. Twos Complement Encoding.</b> An
improvement over ones complement is realized by making each positive binary
number <i>x</i> start with zero and -<i>x</i> = <i>not</i>(<i>x</i>) + 1.
For example,

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/TwosComplmt-Ex1.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Thus, positive (negative) numbers can have infinitely
many leading zeroes (ones).  Twos complement numbers have some
interesting properties, for example, the negation property.  Let
<i>x</i>' denote the negation of binary number <i>x</i> (e.g., if
<i>x</i> = 1010, then <i>x</i>' = 0101).  The following assertion holds:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/TwosComplmt-Ex2.gif"></p>

<blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 12.</b> Consider the following conversion
from the decimal number 4 to -4, then back to 4:
 
</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/TwosComplmt-Ex3.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The steps are shown in blue, with the "trick" of
adding one to the inverted result shown in red (on the left-hand
side), with its result shown in red (on the right).
</p></blockquote>
 
<p align="JUSTIFY">Complementary representations present some interesting
implementational issues.  If one does not differentiate between signed and
unsigned numbers, comparisons can be problematic.  For example, 
if <i>x</i> = 1110101 and <i>y</i> = 0110101, then <i>x</i> &gt; <i>y</i>
if the representation is unsigned, but <i>x</i> &lt; <i>y</i> if the
representation is signed.  Thus, one must consistently use signed or
unsigned number representation in a computer architecture.
 
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Another issue is sign extension when converting from
a reduced-precision representation to a higher precision
representation.  For example, supposed we have an eight-bit twos
complement number <i>x</i> = (1111 1100), that we wish to convert to a 16-bit
representation.  Because positive (negative) twos complement numbers
have an infinite number of leading zeroes (ones), we can simply view
any N-digit twos complement representation as a leftward truncation of
the actual (infinite-length) twos complement representation.  Thus,
expressing <i>x</i> in 16-bit format is merely a matter of filling
the more significant bits with the leading bit of the low-precision form,
e.g., <i>x</i> becomes (1111 1111 1111 1100)).  This also holds for 
extension of leading zeroes, which is another reason that twos complement
numbers are useful in computing.

</p><h4>2.4.2. Datatypes</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As we stated in the introduction (Section 1), one of
the big ideas of computer science is that data is <i>pliable</i> - it
can be anything that the program requires it to be.  In
general-purpose computing or with high-level languages, data can
include integers, floating point numbers, characters, strings, dates,
currency information, text, objects (e.g., abstract datatypes), blobs
in graphics, double precision numbers, as well as signed or unsigned
number representations (as discussed in the previous section).

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">MIPS provides support for numeric datatypes such as
integers (signed and unsigned representations) and floating point
numbers, as well as strings, memory addresses (pointers), and
instructions.  MIPS also supports 16-bit constants (immediates),
halfwords (16 bits), and bytes (8 bit).

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">As shown in Figure 2.19, the <code>lb</code> (load
byte) instruction expressed as <code>lb $s1, 4($s0)</code> transfers
data from the address contained in register <code>$s0</code>, with an
offset of 4 bytes, to the register <code>$s1</code>.  This can also be
accomplished with the <code>lbu</code> (load byte unsigned)
instruction, as shown in Figure 2.19.
 
</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/Figure2.19a-Address1.gif"> <br><br><b>Figure
2.19.</b> Example of the <i>load byte</i> instructions, adapted from
[Maf01].
</p>
 
<p align="JUSTIFY">Another application for which MIPS can be used is
string manipulation, which helps illustrate the use of <code>lb</code>
and <code>sb</code> instructions (byte I/O).  The following example
is illustrative.

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 12.</b> Suppose we want to copy string
<i>x</i> to string <i>y</i>. We can use the C language routine

</p><pre>        void strcpy(char x[ ], char y[ ]) {
           int i ;                        
           i = 0 ;                        # initialize loop counter
           while ( (x[i] = y[i] ) != 0)   # check for end-of-string
             i = i + 1 ;                  # increment loop counter
        }
</pre>
 
<p align="JUSTIFY">Here, <code>strcmp</code> exits when <i>x</i>[i]
and <i>y</i>[i] are unequal, i.e., when a difference is found in
the characters of <i>xy</i> at a given position i.
This is implemented in MIPS, as follows:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-Address-Ex1.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Here, the routine <code>strcpy</code> has three
parts: (1) the <i>prologue</i>, which comprises the first three
statements that set up the stack and initialize the <code>$s0</code>
register; (2) the <i>body</i> that contains the MIPS representation of
the <i>while</i> loop; and (3) the <i>epilogue</i> that resets the
address space (stack pointer) and jumps to the return address (which
we assume was set prior to jumping to <code> strcpy</code> label).
 
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Assume that base addresses for arrays <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i> are found in argument registers <code>$a0</code> and
<code>$a1</code>, while i is in <code>$s0</code>.  In the prologue,
the stack pointer is adjusted and <code>$s0</code> is saved on the
stack. The register <code>$s0</code> is then set to zero, and the loop
begins at label L1.  The address of <i>y</i>[i] is formed by adding
offset i (in <code>$s0</code>) to <i>y</i>.  Note that the offset need not be
multiplied by 4, as in previous examples, because the characters in
<i>x</i>. and <i>y</i> are an array of bytes, not 32-bit words.  To
get the character in <i>y</i>[i] from memory to register, we use the
<code>lb</code> instruction, which puts the character into <code>$t2</code>.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The next step is to transfer the character from
<code>$t2 </code> to memory.  To do this, we first put the address of
<i>x</i>[i] in <code>$t3</code>, then use <code>sb</code> (store byte)
instruction to transfer the character in <code>$t2</code> to that
address.  If the character is a zero (end-of-string character in C),
then we exit the loop and go to label L2.  Otherwise, the loop index
is incremented with the <code>addi</code> instruction, and we return
to L1.  In the epilogue, the stack pointer and <code>$s0</code> are
reset, and control is transferred to the return address.
</p></blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In actual C-language string manipulations, pointers
are used, as discussed in Section 2.6.  This avoids the overhead
associated with loop index manipulation.
 
</p><h4>2.4.3. Addressing</h4> 

<p align="JUSTIFY">MIPS has several types of addressing, including <i>
immediate mode</i> for constant-valued operands.  As stated in Section
2.2.3.1, the <i>common case</i> is that small constants are used
frequently.  Thus, in order to make the execution of operations with
small constants fast, we (1) put the constants in memory then (2) load
them into registers.  A second type of addressing puts constants 
directly into the assembly language instruction (e.g., hardcoded
constants).  We address these constants in immediate mode, for example,
the following <i>add-immediate</i> instruction:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-Address-Ex2.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Immediate mode can be useful for purposes other
than arithmetic.  For example, suppose we want to load a 32-bit
word into a register, but MIPS supports only 16-bit constants.
The trick here is to first load the higher-order bits using the
<i>load upper immediate</i> instruction

</p><pre>        lui $t0, 10101010101010101010</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">which loads the constant (second operand) into the
upper half (more significant 16 bits) of $t0.  We then load the
remainder of the lower order bits using the <i>or-immediate</i>
instruction:
 
</p><pre>        ori $t0, $t0, 10101010101010101010</pre>
 
<p align="JUSTIFY">which works as shown below:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-Address-Ex3.gif"></p>
 
<p align="JUSTIFY">MIPS has several additional addressing modes,
including <i>data</i> and <i>instruction</i> modes.  Data addressing
features register addressing (the fastest and shortest mode), base
addressing (for operands in memory, e.g., <code>lw $t0 20($t1)</code>,
and immediate addressing that hardcodes a constant directly into an
instruction.  We have already studied each of these modes.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Instruction addressing modes include PC-relative
addressing (for branches) and pseudodirect addressing (for jumps).
The term <i>PC</i> means <i>program counter</i>, which is a 
special-purpose address register that points to a given instruction
in the instruction sequencer.  

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In PC-relative addressing, the address is the PC + C
ยท 4, where C denotes a constant hardcoded into a branch
instruction.  This allows the program address space to be (in
principle) as large as 2<sup>32</sup> instructions.  If we simply used
PC, only 2<sup>16</sup> instructions would be allowed (16-bit address
space), which is far too small for modern programs.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In pseudodirect addressing, the address is PC[31:28]
(upper six bits of the PC address) concatenated with the 28-bit word
represented by the 26 bits of address in the jump instruction.  This
is useful for long jumps (not the common case), and can be inserted by
the MIPS assembler, as follows.  In practice, the assembler performs
this insertion of a large jump (to a <i>far target address</i>) by
converting a <code>beq</code> branch to a <code>bne</code> branch, as
shown below.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-Address-Ex4.gif"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Here, the current PC is outside the memory segment in
which local activity occurs (the shaded region in the preceding
illustration).  The 26-bit field in the jump instruction is also a
word address, i.e., it represents a 28-bit byte address.  To make up
the remaining four bits, MIPS uses the upper four bits of the PC.  As
a result, the loader and linker must be careful to avoid placing jumps
across an address boundary of a 256MB segment.  Otherwise, the jump
must be replaced by a jump register instruction, where the full 32-bit
address must be loaded into the register using an immediate-mode
instruction like that shown in the <code>ori</code> example, above.

</p><h3>2.5. MIPS Programs</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mssz/CompOrg/PatHen-Readings.html#ExSec2.5"><b>Reading Assignments and Exercises</b></a> 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">MIPS supports translation of high-level languages (HLL)
such as C to assembly language, then to object code and executable
code.  In this section, we examine this process, shown schematically
in Figure 2.20.

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/Figure2.20-MIPScompile.gif"> <br><b>Figure
2.20.</b> Example of MIPS compilation sequence, adapted from
[Maf01].
</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Here, the C source file <code>foo.c</code> is
compiled using the C compiler (Unix command <code><b>cc</b></code>),
to yield an assembly language program <code>foo.s</code>.  This
program is input to the MIPS assembler (Unix command
<code><b>as</b></code>), producing an object (machine language) module
<code>foo.o</code>.  The linker (Unix command <code><b>ld</b></code>)
links a library <code>lib.o</code> with the object module to produce
the executable file <code>a.out</code>.  When the executable is
invoked (via the Unix command <code><b>a.out</b></code>), the loader
puts the executable code into memory, and the program is run.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The assembler, which is of concern to this course, 
performs the following tasks:

</p><ol><p></p><li><i>Reads and executes directives</i> for special treatment of
           input (per Section 2.5.1)

<p> </p></li><li><i>Replaces pseudoinstructions</i> (shown below in the

           MIPS (shown below to the right of the pseudoinstructions),

           whose structure is overviewed in Section 2.5.3.
</li></ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We next consider assembler directives, which are
somewhat like preprocessor commands in C.

</p><h4>2.5.1. Assembler Directives</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The MIPS assembler supports the following
<i>directives</i>, which do not produce machine language code, but merely
control the functions of the assembler:

</p><ul><p></p><li><b><code>.align n</code></b> - Align the next datum on a

<p>    </p></li><li><b><code>.text</code></b> - Put subsequent items in user text

</li></ul>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Another assembler feature is <i>absolute addressing</i>,
which is described as follows.  Absolute addressing supports
relocation editing by implementing load/store operations to variables
in static memory, conditional branches, jump instructions, and direct
references to data, as shown below:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPSabsaddr-Ex1.gif"> </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In some cases, these references cannot be determined at
assemble time (when the assembler translates MIPS code to machine
language), so temporary data structures are created, as described in
the following section.

</p><h4>2.5.2. Production of Machine Language</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In the simplest case, machine language instructions
can be directly produced from MIPS assembly code.  Here, the basic
information needed to translate the assembly instruction to one or
more machine language instructions is already within the instruction.  
Arithmetic, logical, and shift instructions are in this category.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">With conditional branches, some delay is encountered,
since pseudoinstructions (not directly supported by the MIPS
assembler) have to be translated first into their assembly language
equivalents (instructions directly supported by MIPS).  After all the
pseudo instructions have been translated, it is possible for the
assembler to make a <i>second pass</i>, where the machine language
instructions are counted up, and the branch target addresses (where
the branch instructions transfer control to) can be calculated.  The
PC-relative addressing mode is useful for this step of machine language
production.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Direct (absolute) addressing presents a problem, due
to jumps (<code>j</code> and <code>jal</code> instructions), as well
as direct (absolute) references to data.  These cannot be determined
at this step of the assembly process, so we need to create two tables:
the <i>symbol table</i> and <i>relocation table</i>.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The <i>symbol table</i> contains a list of object
<i>s</i> in the assembly language program that may be used by other
files.  This includes <i>labels</i>, for function calling, and
<i>data</i> (e.g., anything in the <code>data directive</code> or
variables that are to be accessedacrossed files.  On the first pass,
the assembler records label-address pairs.  On the second pass,
machine code is produced.  Thus, it is possible to jump to a subsequent
label without declaring it first.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In contrast, the <i>relocation table</i> is a list of
objects for which the assembled program needs addresses.  This
includes any label jumped to (<code>j</code> or <code>jal</code>
instruction), whether internal or external (including library files).
Also, the relocation table contains any piece of data specified within
the program.

</p><h4>2.5.3. Structure and Creation of Object Module</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The object module contains the following
information:

</p><ul><p></p><li><i>Object File Header</i> contains the size and position of 
       the specific partitions of the object file

<p>    </p></li><li><i>Text Segment</i> is the place where the machine code resides

<p>    </p></li><li><i>Data Segment</i> contains the binary representation of data
       in the source file

<p>    </p></li><li><i>Relocation Information</i> identifies lines of code that
       need to be processed further (e.g., direct addresses)

<p>    </p></li><li><i>Symbol Table</i> contains the list of the current program's
       labels and data that can be referenced

<p>    </p></li><li><i>Debugging Information</i> specifies link points and entry
       points to various routines, libraries, etc.
</li></ul>

<h4>2.5.4. Linker</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The linker combines object (.o) files into an executable
file.  This enables separate (independent) compilation of files.
However, only the modified files are typically recompiled.  For
example, Windows NT source code has over 30 million lines of code, so
we want to perform <i>incremental compilation</i> on this large
corpus of code, rather than attempting to compile it all at once.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The linker also edits the links in the
<code>jal</code> (jump-and-link) instructions, substituting addresses
where appropriate.  This is why the linker used to be called the
<i>link editor</i>.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The linker performs the following steps:

</p><ul><p></p><li><b>Step 1.</b> Assembles the text segments from each .o file to
       get a composite of all the code in the program

<p>    </p></li><li><b>Step 2.</b> Concatenate the data segments from each .o file
       and append to the end of the text segment

<p>    </p></li><li><b>Step 3.</b> Resolve the references by going through the
       relocation table and processing each entry, filling in all 
       absolute addresses.  Notify the user of any unresolvable references.
</li></ul>

<p align="JUSTIFY">There are four types of references that need to be
resolved, which are:

</p><ul><p></p><li><i>PC-relative</i> references such as branch instruction
       targets, which are never relocated
      
<p>    </p></li><li><i>Absolute addresses</i> such as jump targets, which are always
       relocated 

<p>    </p></li><li><i>External references</i> such as jump-and-link targets,
       which are always relocated; and

<p>    </p></li><li><i>Data references</i> (e.g., from <code>lui</code> and
       <code>ori</code> instructions), which are always relocated
</li></ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The linker assumes the first word of the first text
segment is at 0x00000000.  Since the linker knows the length and
ordering of each text and data segment, the linker can calculate the
address of each internal or external jump target as well as the address
of each piece of data being referenced.

</p><h4>2.5.5. Loader</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The linker produces an executable file that is stored
on disk.  The loader puts the executable code in memory and starts it
running.  As a result, the loader is often thought of as a part of the
operating system.  The loader performs the following functions:

</p><ol><p></p><li><i>Read header</i> to determine the size and the text and
       data segments

<p>    </p></li><li><i>Create new address space</i> for the program that is large
       enough to hold the text and data segments, and also the stack

<p>    </p></li><li><i>Copy instructions and data</i>  from executable file memory

<p>    </p></li><li><i>Initialize the machine registers</i>, for example, <code>$sp</code> points
       to the first free stack location

<p>    </p></li><li><i>Jump to the initial routine</i>  that copies the program
       arguments from the stack to the registers, then sets the PC

<p>    </p></li><li><i>When the main routine returns</i>, the start-up routine
       terminates the program execution with a system call.
</li></ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Thus, the loader can be thought of as the runtime
module.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In summary, the compiler converts a single HLL file
into an assembly language file.  The assembler translates
pseudoinstructions, converts what instructions it can directly to
machine language, and creates a checklist for the linker called the
relocation table.  This changes each source file into an object file.
The linker combines several object files (including libraries), and
resolves absolute addresses.  The loader loads the executable produced
by the linker into memory and begins program execution.

</p><h3>2.6. Pointers and Arrays</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mssz/CompOrg/PatHen-Readings.html#ExSec2.6"><b>Reading Assignments and Exercises</b></a> 

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In this section, we discuss in greater detail the
issues surrounding pointers (addresses) and contiguous regions of
memory that store values in arrays (as discussed in Section
2.6.1). Salient implementational issues include argument passing as
well as the lifetime and scope of storage (Section 2.6.2).  Uses of
pointers include pointer arithmetic (Section 2.6.3) and the use of
pointers with arrays (Section 2.6.4).  

</p><h4>2.6.1. Basic Pointer Concepts</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Definition.</b> A <i>pointer</i> is a variable
that contains the address of another variable.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In practice, a pointer can be thought of as the
HLL equivalent of a machine language memory address.  We use pointers
to express a program's functionality more compactly and efficiently,
and to perform memory operations that cannot be done another way.
Unfortunately, pointer mis-use comprises the largest amount of bugs
in a typical program, with the following two errors predominating:

</p><ol><p></p><li><i>Dangling Reference</i> - when a pointer points to a
       memory location that has been prematurely freed

<p>    </p></li><li><i>Memory Leaks</i> - when a memory location has been
       freed too late, or not freed at all, and a pointer still
       should reference it.
</li></ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As a result of these defects, a program must be
restarted frequently to avoid accumulation of dangling references or
leaks.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Let us consider several example of pointer use in the
C language.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Suppose a variable <i>v</i> has value 100, and is
located in memory at address 0x10000000.  The unary operator (&amp;) gives
the memory address of <i>v</i>, for example: <code>p = &amp;v;</code>
while the (*) operator gives the value that pointer <i>p</i> points to,
for example: <code>value = *p</code>.  We call the (*) operation 
<i>dereferencing</i>, and it is important in assembler, as shown below:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-pointers-Ex1.gif"> </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Thus, the (*) operator, used to the right (left) of
the equals sign, can implement a load (store) operation.

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 13.</b> Assume that the variable <i>c</i>
is an integer, has value 100, and resides in memory at address
0x10000000.  Further assume that the pointer <i>p</i> is stored in
register <code>$a0</code>, and that the variable <i>x</i> is stored in
register <code>$s0</code>.  The following code fragment is
illustrative of dereferencing.  the numbered code is C language, with
assembly instructions listed below:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-pointers-Ex2.gif"> </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The first item puts the address of <i>c</i> in
<i>p</i>.  The second item dereferences <i>p</i> to put the value
stored at that address in <i>x</i>, which is a synonym for
<code>$s0</code>.  Finally, the memory location whose address is in
<i>p</i> receives the value 200.  Note that the <code>addi</code> (add
immediate) operator is used to put the value 200 in register
<code>$t0</code>, then the contents of <code>$t0</code> are stored in
the location pointed to by <code>$a0</code> (which contains the value
of <i>p</i>).
</p></blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We already know about memory leaks and dangling
pointers.  This concept of <i>data persistence</i> leads us to ask how
long pointers last within a program.  We discuss this in the following
section.

</p><h4>2.6.2. Storage Lifetime and Scope</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">There are three types of pointer allocation that
affect the storage lifetime and scope of the pointer:

</p><ul><li><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Automatic</i> (stack allocated) pointers
    typically reference local variables of a function.  These pointers
    are volatile, in the sense that they are created at the function
    call, and are released (freed) upon return to the calling
    procedure.  As a result, the scope of the pointer is the called
    function.

</p><p> </p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Heap allocated</i> pointers are created
    by in invocation to the <code>malloc</code> routine, and are 
    released when explicitly freed.  Their scope can be local or
    global to a given program.  If not freed, they can cause memory
    leaks.

</p><p> </p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>External</i> (static) pointers are created
    at the program's invocation, and exist for the length of the program.
    Thus, their scope is global to the program.
</p></li></ul>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We will next examine how we can manipulate these
different types of pointers to achieve different addressing modes.

</p><h4>2.6.3. Pointer Arithmetic</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Various types of arithmetic operations can be 
performed on pointers.  For example, addresses can be incremented
and decremented, assigned, dereferenced, etc.  The following example
is illustrative of memory operations, where the array <i>z</i>
contains various values referenced by pointers:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-pointers-Ex3.gif"> </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Note that there are two instances of mistakes using
pointers.  The first involves hardcoding a direct address into a
C-like program - a very bad idea, for two reasons: (1) one can
reference a protected part of memory where system resources reside, or
(2) future operating system or compiler revisions might not support
such a modification.  The second error, which is an illegal operation,
involves trying to make the entire array z point to the scalar
variable y, using the statement <code>z = &amp;y</code>.

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 14.</b> As a further illustration of
pointer usage, consider the following C code:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-pointers-Ex4.gif"> </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">which is translated into the following assembly
language instructions:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-pointers-Ex5.gif"> </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Note that the argument in <code>$a0</code>
dereferences the actual argument variable (a string <i>s</i>), so that
the pointer <i>p</i> points to the characters in the argument.  The
<code>addi</code> instruction is used to increment <i>p</i> so it
points to the next character in the string.  In both cases, the
<code>lbu</code> (load byte unsigned) instruction is used to effect
the dereferencing.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">After the loop completes, the length of the string is
equal to the different <i>p</i> - <i>s</i>.  This is yet another example of
pointers can be used both as addresses and as counters.  This makes the
assembly code much more compact, and thus produces fewer instructions.
</p></blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">When using pointers in an argument list, we implement
the latter of the follwoing two argument passing modes:

</p><ul><p></p><li><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Call by Value</i> passes a <i>copy</i>
of the item in a given argument position to the function or procedure.

</p><p></p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Call by Reference</i> passes a
<i>pointer</i> to a given argument to the function or procedure.
</p></li></ul>

<p align="JUSTIFY">In practice, it is easier to pass single word variables
by value, since this avoids the overhead of pointer manipulation.

</p><h4>2.6.4. Use of Pointers in Array Manipulation</h4>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Suppose we have an array (e.g., <b>a</b>[100]) in the
argument list.  This can be passed in two ways.  The Pascal language
uses call-by-value (e.g., copies the entire 100 words of <b>a</b> onto
the stack).  This is prohibitively costly for large arrays.  In
contrast, C (call-by-reference) passes a pointer (one word long) to
the array <b>a</b>, with the pointer being stored in a register for
fast manipulation.

</p><p align="JUSTIFY">There are four versions of array manipulation for a
binary arithmetic operation (e.g., adding arrays <b>a</b>[100] +
<b>b</b>[100] and putting the result in <b>c</b>[100]).

</p><p></p><ol><p></p><li>Result array is passed to the function or procedure.

<p></p></li><li>The result is put in a local array on the stack, and a pointer
       to the local array is passed to the function or procedure.

<p></p></li><li>The result array is allocated on the heap.

<p></p></li><li>The result array is declared static.
</li></ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">We discuss each of these techniques with an example,
as follows.  Each example assumes that we have an array addition
routine called <code>sumarray</code>.

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 15 (Array passed to Function).</b>  Given the
following C code:

</p><pre>        <b>int a[100],b[100],c[100];
         sumarray(a, b, c);</b>
</pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">the meaning of this C calling convention is 

</p><pre>         <b>sumarray(&amp;a[0], &amp;b[0], &amp;c[0]);</b>  </pre>

<p align="JUSTIFY">If we want to use assembly language to  pass
pointers that reference arrays, then we need to compute the address
size (.e.g, a 100-element array requires 400 bytes of storage in
MIPS).  This is done as follows:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-pointarray-Ex1.gif"> </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Note that the <code>addi</code> instruction is used
to set the base addresses, with a[0] starting at $gp.  Then, the
<code>jal</code> instruction is used to invoke <code>sumarray</code>, as discussed
previously.  The C code and compiled assembly code for the function
<code>sumarray</code> looks like this:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-pointarray-Ex1comp.gif"> </p>
</blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The second method is to put the result array on the
stack as a local array, then return the pointer to that array to the
function or procedure, as follows.

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 16 (Array Pointer passed to Function).</b>
In the following code, notice how the prologue portion of the assembly
code uses the <code>addi</code> instruction to allocate space for the
result array <b>c</b>, set the pointer, and pass it to
<code>$v0</code> (the first result register):

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-pointarray-Ex2.gif"> </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The loop is straightforward, and begins with a limits
check that branches to the exit point if the loop index (in register
<code>$a0</code>) is exceeded.  Next, the operands a[i] and b[i] are
respectively loaded into registers <code>$t1</code> and
<code>$t2</code>, the addition operation is performed, and the result
is stored in memory location referenced by <code>$t3</code> with zero
offset.  The input operand pointers and result pointer are reset, then
the jump instruction transfers control to the loopback point.
</p></blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The next two techniques are not used very often.
Placing the array on the heap renders the array information not reused
unless freed.  This leads to memory leaks.  Using static arrays is
memory-consumptive, but tends to be employed in C libraries.

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 17 (Result Allocated on Heap).</b> Given
the following C code:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-pointarray-Ex3.gif"> </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">the compiled version is as follows:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-pointarray-Ex3comp.gif"> </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Here, the heap allocation is accomplished by the
call <code>jal malloc</code>, which is necessarily bracketed by
the saving and restoring of the arguments.  Note the many additional
lines of code that are required beyond those shown in Example 16.
As a result, memory allocation looks like this:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-pointarray-Ex3heap.gif"> </p>

</blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The final example uses static memory for array
storage.

</p><blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Example 18 (Static Memory).</b> Given the
following source code fragment:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-pointarray-Ex4.gif"> </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Note that the <code>static</code> directive
causes the array to be in static memory, as shown below:

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Organization of Computer Systems_ ISA, Machine Language, Number Systems_files/MIPS-pointarray-Ex4mem.gif"> </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As a result, the array <b>c</b> will be changed
next time <code>sumarray</code> is invoked.  This method is typically
used in C libraries, and is very expensive from the viewpoint of
memory usage.
</p></blockquote>
